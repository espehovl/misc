This is just a simple, innocent SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model which I made during this ongoing pandemic. 

It makes GIFs demonstrating how a " contagious disease" spreads in a population of dots randomly interacting with eachother.

A few example GIFs are included in this folder, and more might come at a later stage.
